# js-Promise

Create a promise that will ask the user for both number 1 and number 2. The
promise will check if the entry values were numbers, and then you will resolve
it with an output similar to this: 3 + 7 = 10 otherwise, the rejection message
will be both, or either 3 or 7 (is or are) not number(s).
